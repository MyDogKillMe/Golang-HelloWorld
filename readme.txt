Then build it with the go tool:
C:\Users\Gopher\go\src\hello> go build hello.go
The command above will build an executable named hello.exe in the current directory alongside your source code. 

Execute it to see the greeting:
C:\Users\Gopher\go\src\hello> hello
hello, world
If you see the "hello, world" message then your Go installation is working.
